Problem
Part 1
Determine whether there is a relationship between GDP and the age that developers of a country first start coding. Extract and create one or more tables to store the data necessary to perform this comparison. Ideally use a visual plot to support your conclusion(s).

CSV file is stored locally and uploaded to Mysql
Since the CSV file size is high it is not added as part of git. The file can be found here(https://diemensys-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/p/sanjay/EvFYDiF-OF1GvrKivqJzwXgBlsU7jgayTN_1eIPVvMiejg?e=15450j) and should be added to 'ABN/data' folder for the code to work.
